# Profile Page --Attempt 2
###### 6/13/18

This was the second homework assigned in Bootcamp. The purpose was to learn how to use Bootstrap, as well as introducing us to the concept of CSS libraries. This, of course, made designing the profile page much faster.
Also included in this folder is a rather weak attempt at doing media queries for project one, which probably should have gotten it's own git repo.

**Known Flaws**: The media queries for homework1 don't work at all.
